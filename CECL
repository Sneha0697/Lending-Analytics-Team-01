What is CECL?

CECL is a new accounting standard update that was finalized back in 2016 by Financial Accounting Standards Board, 
or FASB for short. What CECL basically does is require lenders to provide an estimation of how much they expect in 
credit losses over the lifetime of a loan to better account for risk. Politicians pushed through CECL following the 
Great Recession of 2008-09. Many opine that regulations and policies treat the last crisis rather than the current 
one, but for now, CECL compliance is what we have to work toward.
